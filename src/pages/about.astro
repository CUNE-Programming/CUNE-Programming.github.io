            <p class="flex-col text-[#808080] max-[479px]:text-sm">
              Our job is to make you the best computer scientist that you can
              be. To that end, we teach industry-standard tools, practices, and
              languages. Both hard and soft skills. But skills as a developer
              are only half the battle. To be the best computer scientist that
              you can be requires skills and knowledge of the field itself. At
              Concordia you'll be at a program where each professor knows you.
              As a member of the team, you'll compete in nation-wide and
              world-wide competitions to push your ability to the next level.
