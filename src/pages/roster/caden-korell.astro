    Caden Korell is a new student at CUNE this year. He hopes to learn a whole
    lot about computers and programming, and perhaps have some fun while he's at
    it. In his free time, Caden can be caught grinding Hollow Knight Steel Soul
    or cleaning up the pot against his friends in poker. He has plenty of hot
    takes about some recent movies.
